#summary SVN Basics

= Getting started with SVN =

  * Checking out code: (see http://code.google.com/p/jawpintos/source/checkout) with say 'jawpintos' as root directory:
     * svn checkout https://jawpintos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jawpintos --username your_gmail_id
  * Adding a file (say README.txt) to the root directory:
     * jawpintos> svn add README.txt
  * Edit file using vi or any other IDE
  * Seeing what files are changed in your local version that are not yet 'committed' into the repository:
     * jawpintos> svn add README.txt
