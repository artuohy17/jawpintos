#summary SVN Basics

= Getting started with SVN =

  # Checking out code: (see http://code.google.com/p/jawpintos/source/checkout) with say 'jawpintos' as root directory:
{{{
> svn checkout https://jawpintos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jawpintos --username your_gmail_id
}}}
  # Adding a file (say mynewfile.txt) to the root directory:
{{{
> cd jawpintos
jawpintos> svn add mynewfile.txt
}}}
  # Edit file using vi or any other IDE
  # Seeing what files are changed in your local 'checked out' version that are not yet 'committed' into the repository (Status codes: M: your changes need to be merged to repository, C: conflicts exist and you need to resolve them, A: you added your file to the repository, you still need to add them, ?: File is not added to the repository):
{{{
jawpintos> cd sandbox;
jawpintos/sandbox> vi README.txt (make some changes)
jawpintos/sandbox> svn status
M       README.txt
}}}
  # Checking differences between your version and version in repository:
{{{
jawpintos/sandbox> svn diff README.txt
Index: README.txt
===================================================================
--- README.txt	(revision 7)
+++ README.txt	(working copy)

-First version

  # Committing (checking in) all your changes in the current directory into the repository with a simple comment that goes with the commit:
{{{
jawpintos/sandbox> svn ci -m 'my comment'
}}}
  # or Committing particular files into the repository:
{{{
jawpintos/sandbox> svn ci -m 'my comment' README.txt
Sending        README.txt
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 8.
