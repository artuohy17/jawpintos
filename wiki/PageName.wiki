#summary SVN Basics

= Getting started with SVN =

  # Checking out code: (see http://code.google.com/p/jawpintos/source/checkout) with say 'jawpintos' as root directory:
{{{
> svn checkout https://jawpintos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jawpintos --username your_gmail_id
}}}
  # Adding a file (say mynewfile.txt) to the root directory:
{{{
> cd jawpintos
jawpintos> svn add mynewfile.txt
}}}
  # Edit file using vi or any other IDE
  # Seeing what files are changed in your local 'checked out' version that are not yet 'committed' into the repository:
{{{
jawpintos> svn status .
A       .
A       README.txt
}}}
